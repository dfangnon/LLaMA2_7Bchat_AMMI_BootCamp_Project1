# LLaMA2_7Bchat_AMMI_BootCamp_Project1
This is the repo of my initial BootCamp Project, SenHealth_Chatbot: Using Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) to translate healthcare information into local languages: Case of Wolof in Senegal.
- The use of LLaMA to translate healthcare information into local languages could improve access to healthcare in rural Senegal. LLaMA is a large language model that can understand and translate a wide range of healthcare information. In this research, we will explore the use of LLaMA to translate healthcare information into Wolof, the most widely spoken language in Senegal. We will use LLaMA to translate a variety of healthcare resources, including medical leaflets, patient education materials, and healthcare websites. We will evaluate the quality of the translations by comparing them to human-translated versions and collecting feedback from healthcare professionals and patients. The results of this research will provide insights into the potential of LLaMA to improve access to healthcare in rural Senegal.
- The project idea is to use LLaMA to translate healthcare information into Wolof, the most widely spoken language in Senegal. The goal is to make healthcare information more accessible to people who speak local languages in rural Senegal.
